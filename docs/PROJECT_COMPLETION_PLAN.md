# Project Completion Plan

This document outlines the technical work required to transform the prototype
in this repository into a production-quality, fully private cryptocurrency with
user-friendly node deployment and wallet experiences. The roadmap is organized
into themes that can be executed in parallel by specialized teams.

## 1. Core protocol hardening

- **Define a monetary policy**: Specify emission schedule, block reward, supply
  cap and halving mechanics. Implement block subsidy calculations, reward
  validation and coinbase transaction generation.
- **Ledger state tracking**: Persist unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) and
  maintain balances by scanning ring signatures and commitments while protecting
  privacy. Introduce wallet view keys to derive spendable outputs without
  deanonymizing participants.
- **Chain synchronization**: Implement long-range chain validation, checkpoint
  support and fork choice rules. Add block versioning to enable network upgrades
  without breaking compatibility.
- **Consensus improvements**: Replace the toy proof-of-work with a tunable
  difficulty retargeting algorithm. Analyze resistance to selfish mining and
  other consensus attacks.

## 2. Peer-to-peer networking

- **Node discovery and gossip**: Implement a P2P layer for peer exchange,
  transaction propagation and block dissemination. Support NAT traversal and
  peer reputation scoring.
- **Mempool coordination**: Track pending transactions, prioritize by fees and
  enforce resource limits. Guard against spam and denial-of-service attacks.
- **State synchronization APIs**: Provide fast bootstrapping (headers-first,
  checkpoints) and incremental chain updates for lightweight clients.

## 3. Privacy enhancements

- **Ring-size and decoy selection policy**: Enforce minimum ring sizes, robust
  decoy selection and churn strategies to prevent transaction tracing.
- **Confidential amounts**: Transition from simple Pedersen commitments to
  modern range proofs (e.g., Bulletproofs) to verify amounts without disclosure.
- **Network-layer privacy**: Integrate Dandelion++ or similar to hide the origin
  of broadcast transactions. Document Tor/I2P support for node operators.
- **Auditing and view-only keys**: Provide selective disclosure mechanisms so
  users can prove holdings without revealing transaction graphs.

## 4. Wallet experience

- **Seed management**: Generate mnemonic seeds (BIP39-like) and deterministic
  key derivation for view/spend keys. Offer backup and restore flows.
- **Transaction lifecycle**: Track incoming/outgoing transfers, confirmations
  and pending states. Provide balance, history, memo support and address book
  features.
- **Client implementations**: Ship both CLI and GUI wallets. Implement QR code
  support, hardware wallet integration and watch-only mode.
- **Synchronization**: Implement background blockchain scanning, light client
  mode and efficient refresh using view keys and checkpoints.

## 5. Node server deployment

- **Service packaging**: Provide Docker images, Helm charts and systemd units.
  Document environment variables, configuration files and secrets handling.
- **Observability**: Expose metrics, structured logging and health probes for
  monitoring. Add tracing hooks for transaction debugging.
- **Upgrades and migrations**: Provide tooling to snapshot chain state, apply
  schema migrations and roll back faulty deployments safely.
- **Security hardening**: Define threat models, secure RPC interfaces with
  authentication and TLS, and offer optional hardware security module (HSM)
  integration for validator keys.

## 6. Compliance, QA and tooling

- **Formal verification and audits**: Commission reviews of cryptographic
  primitives, consensus logic and wallet code. Add reproducible builds.
- **Extensive testing**: Expand unit, integration and fuzz tests. Stand up
  regression suites, testnets and chaos engineering tooling.
- **Documentation and SDKs**: Produce developer guides, API references, example
  DApps and language bindings to integrate with the network.
- **Governance and upgrade path**: Document network parameters, governance
  processes and emergency procedures for coordinating hard forks.

## 7. Launch checklist

1. Deploy public testnet with telemetry dashboards and bug bounty program.
2. Execute security audits and remediate findings.
3. Publish wallet binaries, deployment guides and SDK packages.
4. Announce mainnet launch with monitoring, support rotations and contingency
   plans for incident response.

By delivering on these themes we turn the current prototype into a robust,
private cryptocurrency ecosystem comparable to Bitcoin in functionality while
preserving user anonymity end-to-end.
